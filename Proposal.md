## Motivation

Wikipedia :*"In finance, **momentum** is the empirically observed tendency for rising asset prices or securities return to rise further, and falling prices to keep falling."*

While the definition of momentum seem simple, financial experts categorizes this as a market anomaly. This project aim to analize, using the MSCI World Index, if the simple assumption on financial momentum is supported by data during the last years (2020-2025). The goal is to see if, by filtering a subset of the best momentum stocks, we can out-perform the passive benchmark index. 
To prove the effectivness of a momentum strategy, I will compare to the benchmark index a subset of stocks with the lowest momentum values.
