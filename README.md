# 📈 Momentum Strategy on the MSCI World Index

## Overview
This project aim to analyze the **Momentum Effect** in the global equity markets using data from the **MSCI World Index** dataset, composed of 1465 stocks.
The goal is to test if stocks that have performed well in the past continue to do so in the short term. These stocks's performance are then compared to the benchmark using equal-weighted momentum portfolios. 

## Motivation
The **Momentum Effect** is one of the most persistent market anomalies. 
Firstly documented by **Jegadeesh and Titman (1993)**, it shows how stocks with strong past performances tend to keep this trend in the future.

On this idea, the project aims to:
- Measure the momentum's strenght along all stocks
- Build and evaluate whether momentum-based portfolios can outperform a passive benchmark (iShares in this case)
- Compare portfolios on theirs lookback periods.

- **Dataset**: MSCI World Index[1]
- **Period**: from 31.12.2018 to 30.09.2025
- **Frequency**: monthly prices converted to monthly returns
